Codex CLI ships a generated, async-summarized memory store at `~/.codex/memories/`

It's a first-party feature:

- documented at [developers.openai.com/codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex)
- and fully open-sourced at [github.com/openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex).

In this *In Context* article, we walk through how memory is handled in Codex CLI.

Codex is OpenAI's coding agent and it ships in three variants: a CLI, an IDE extension, and a cloud workspace inside ChatGPT.

The CLI is the most heavily documented surface and its memory internals are open-sourced so that's the one we look at here. Most of what follows applies transitively to the IDE extension, which shares the same `~/.codex/` config and memory layout.

## The Memories architecture

Codex's memory lives in one directory: `~/.codex/memories/`. The directory holds a fixed set of markdown files. No SQLite, no embedding index or opaque blobs.

The files that matter:

- `memory_summary.md`: the consolidated view the next session reads first
- `MEMORY.md`: the long-form merged memory file, grepped on demand
- `raw_memories.md`: pre-consolidation extraction output
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: skill-specific memories
- `rollout_summaries/<slug>.md`: per-session summaries that feed the consolidation pass

That's the whole memory layer. Everything else is the pipeline that fills it and the read path that pulls from it.

## How memories are written

The write path splits into two phases.

**Phase 1 is per-rollout.** When a session has been idle long enough (six hours by default), Codex claims a startup job, samples the conversation against a strict-schema extraction prompt, runs every output through a secret-redactor, and stores the result in a local state database. Nothing reaches the memory directory yet.

**Phase 2 is global.** It acquires a global lock (held in the state DB) so two consolidation passes never run in parallel. It loads recent Phase 1 outputs, syncs them to disk, checks whether the resulting workspace actually differs from what's there, and only then spawns a separate consolidation sub-agent. The sub-agent reads the candidates, decides what to merge, what to patch, what to drop, and writes the diff back to `~/.codex/memories/`.

Both phases use configurable models (`extract_model` for Phase 1, `consolidation_model` for Phase 2), and the consolidation pass runs as a separate sub-agent rather than inline with the user's chat.

## How memories are loaded

At session start, Codex reads `memory_summary.md` whole, truncates it to fit a fixed **5,000-token** budget (a constant defined in the read-path crate, not in the public docs), and injects the result into the developer instructions. That truncated summary is the entirety of what the agent gets pre-loaded.

For anything not in the summary, the agent is instructed to grep `MEMORY.md` directly. The read-path template tells the agent: extract keywords from the summary, search `MEMORY.md`, open relevant rollout-summary files if pointed to, stop if nothing matches. The whole search budget is kept under a small number of steps.

There is no embedding store, no similarity search, no rerank step. It's plain text and substring matching, by design. The trade is predictability and zero retrieval-time cost in exchange for not finding facts whose query and stored phrasing don't share keywords.

## The mechanics that govern it

A handful of configuration knobs control everything above. Worth knowing before relying on the system.

- **Off by default.** A master `features.memories` flag has to be turned on. Once on, two sub-switches govern the runtime: `generate_memories` (write) and `use_memories` (read). Both default to `true` after the feature is enabled.
- **Idle threshold.** `min_rollout_idle_hours` (default 6) sets the minimum idle time before a session is eligible for Phase 1. Active sessions never trigger it.
- **Consolidation caps.** `max_raw_memories_for_consolidation` (default 256, capped at 4,096) bounds how many recent rollouts the consolidation pass considers per run.
- **Aging.** `max_rollout_age_days` (default 30) stops considering threads older than that for memory generation. `max_unused_days` (default 30) makes memories that haven't been recalled in that window ineligible for the next consolidation pass.
- **Rate-limit-aware.** `min_rate_limit_remaining_percent` (default 25) backs off consolidation when the user's API quota is low, so background work never starves foreground requests.
- **Secret redaction.** Built-in scrubbing for credentials before any memory hits disk.
- **Geographic limit.** At launch, Memories is not available in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland. Users in those regions don't have access at all.

## Where it stops

The shortest framing: this memory system is not robust. It's a single user's markdown files inside a fixed token budget, and most of the failure modes follow from that.

- **Hard token cap on what's loaded.** `memory_summary.md` is truncated to 5,000 tokens at every session start. Anything past the cap is silently dropped. No warning, no log. The agent simply doesn't see it.
- **Keyword-only fallback.** Anything that didn't make it into the summary has to be findable in `MEMORY.md` by literal substring match. Paraphrased facts are invisible. "What's our deploy command?" will not find "production deploys go through `make ship-prod`" unless one of those exact terms is stored.
- **Grep cost grows with the file.** `MEMORY.md` is searched linearly. For a long-lived user with months of accumulated memories, every miss-then-grep costs more.
- **Generated state only, not editable.** The docs frame `~/.codex/memories/` as Codex-managed. Hand-editing memories is not the supported path. Anything the user actually wants the agent to always know goes in `AGENTS.md` instead.
- **Idle-gate fragility.** Sessions need to sit idle six hours before they become eligible for consolidation. A developer working in back-to-back coding sprints may never trigger it.
- **Local-only state.** `~/.codex/memories/` is per-user, per-machine filesystem state. No cross-machine sync, no team sharing, no remote backing store.
- **Geographic gate.** Memories is blocked in EEA, UK, and Switzerland at launch.

Production scenarios that hit these limits

The structural limits matter most in concrete cases that show up in real teams.

## How Mem0 fits

Mem0 is a memory layer that sits between the agent and a persistent store.

For Codex specifically, there is a MCP integration documented at [docs.mem0.ai/integrations/codex](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/codex).

Codex CLI supports MCP servers natively. They're configured in `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers.<name>]` ([config-reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference)). The minimal Mem0 setup is one block:

```toml
[mcp_servers.mem0]
url = "https://mcp.mem0.ai/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "MEM0_API_KEY"
```

That single block exposes nine MCP tools to Codex: `add_memory`, `search_memories`, `get_memories`, `get_memory`, `update_memory`, `delete_memory`, `delete_all_memories`, `delete_entities`, `list_entities`.

Codex's agent picks them up the same way it picks up any other MCP tool surface.

What changes underneath:

- **Persistent, cross-machine memory.** The local `~/.codex/memories/` ceiling is gone. The same Mem0 store follows the user across laptops, servers, and CI environments. No regeneration from scratch on a new machine.
- **Cross-tool memory.** A user running Codex CLI for terminal work and Cursor for editor work can point both at the same Mem0 backend. A fact captured during a Codex CLI session ("the staging deploy script swallows errors silently, prefer the production-style output for the same diagnostic") surfaces inside the next Cursor Agent run on the same project. The user doesn't have to copy anything between the two tools.
- **Semantic recall.** Mem0 retrieves by meaning, via an embedding-backed search. Codex's native recall reads `memory_summary.md` whole and falls back to grep over `MEMORY.md`: fast and predictable, but unable to find a stored fact whose phrasing differs from the query. With Mem0, asking "what's our deploy command?" finds "production deploys go through `make ship-prod`" even though the words don't overlap.
- **Per-user isolation.** Each user's `userId` scopes their memory. Three teammates with the same Mem0 backend keep separate stores.
- **No 5,000-token summary cap.** Retrieval is ranked semantic search over the actual store, not a whole-file load of a single summary file. Large memory bases stay usable instead of being truncated to fit the developer-instructions budget.
- **Real-time updates.** Mem0 writes memories as the conversation happens, not on a six-hour idle gate. The next session sees what the last one taught it.
- **Available where Memories isn't.** EEA, UK, and Switzerland users get a memory layer that doesn't depend on Codex's regional rollout.

Codex CLI's memory layer is carefully designed in the coding agent space today: two-phase background consolidation, secret redaction, a grep-based read path with predictable token cost, and a pipeline that's open-source end-to-end.

If you're running Codex CLI today and any of those gaps look familiar, the Mem0 integration takes about a minute — [docs.mem0.ai/integrations/codex](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/codex)
